common_voice_ko_36552124.mp3	For it is a tree for food, and for beauty, and for wisdom, and for covetousness.	dev
common_voice_ko_36552127.mp3	And I vaguely remember what my mother used to say.	dev

common_voice_ko_35923139.mp3	So I envisioned a Zen monk sitting in a rickshaw, racing through the bustling city of Seoul.	dev
common_voice_ko_35923173.mp3	But Shin had nowhere else to rest his aching legs but here.	dev
common_voice_ko_35923174.mp3	It's not that you're struggling because you can't throw a spur down the hallway you came in.	dev

common_voice_ko_35923234.mp3	The sick man's body is already chilled and his face is blue.	dev
common_voice_ko_35923235.mp3	And pull me out of the unknown and painful cases.	dev
common_voice_ko_35923238.mp3	Can I deposit right now?	dev
common_voice_ko_35923254.mp3	This was the end of the coinage as a mint.	dev
common_voice_ko_35923255.mp3	The sun has gone down and the yard work is done.	dev
common_voice_ko_35923256.mp3	He headed back the way he came, toward the bell.	dev
common_voice_ko_35923268.mp3	He grabbed his brother by the shoulders and shook him in delight.	dev

common_voice_ko_36524855.mp3	It's been a long time since you've given up on yourself.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524856.mp3	And he looked everywhere as if he were surprised at something, but he didn't see me.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524857.mp3	He breathed heavily and lay back down on his pillow.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524868.mp3	The great railroad bridge in front of here has collapsed, so no trains will come.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524870.mp3	And I thought, “I'll go to Mongkumpo again tomorrow and stay a few days.	dev

common_voice_ko_36524900.mp3	Shin was quite surprised to hear his father say this.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524902.mp3	When Young-sook returns home, she is greeted by Chun-woo and Chang-ha.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524903.mp3	Somehow, he was bored with this life and wanted to try something new, anything.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524916.mp3	But I can't leave Cheongseokgol.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524917.mp3	I clap my hands together inside, as I used to do in the kitchen.	dev

common_voice_ko_36524939.mp3	Do not strive for riches, but forsake thy private wisdom.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524950.mp3	I listened for a while, wondering what was being said.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524951.mp3	I'll tell them I'll be there.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524952.mp3	I thought that conventional farmers only needed to hang seaweed, but I was wrong.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524953.mp3	His right hand slipped into the kiln water.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524982.mp3	He rushes over to shake her hand, glances at the detective standing beside him, and backs away.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524983.mp3	Even at school, going up and down stairs was very painful because my legs felt heavy and sore.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524984.mp3	The Zen master picked up the cotton boll and showed it to the old woman.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524997.mp3	Young-sook broke the heavy silence with a light cough.	dev
common_voice_ko_36524998.mp3	Life will be much easier if you think about it a little.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525000.mp3	At other times, they throw their hands up in the air like they're seeing a goblin.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525001.mp3	The stars are still in the wind tonight.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525116.mp3	Young-shin glances over at Dong-hyuk, his expression a mixture of delight and resentment.	dev

common_voice_ko_36525130.mp3	And then some of the girls turned around and said, well, I confessed to the bishop.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525131.mp3	And then I looked directly into my moonlit face and said	dev
common_voice_ko_36525133.mp3	So I couldn't afford to build a school that would have cost me 5 million won.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525134.mp3	I rolled my eyes and cursed my stomach.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525146.mp3	Thank you.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525148.mp3	He throws out his hands, falls to the ground, and chases after you in a frenzy.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525149.mp3	What is visible?	dev
common_voice_ko_36525151.mp3	The Zen master's heart leapt into his throat, and he sat up straight.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525167.mp3	No matter how boring winter is, once it's over, spring will be here before you know it.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525199.mp3	Qilongyi raised his hand and sat down, sobbing as if his conscience had been pricked.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525200.mp3	I worried for the poor children of Joseon until the point where I fell down from the pain of my body.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525202.mp3	The gentleman is a man of wealth and prestige.	dev

common_voice_ko_36525266.mp3	My	dev
common_voice_ko_36525267.mp3	Feeling overwhelmed, Young-sook finishes her sentence and falls to the ground crying.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525291.mp3	Donghyuk's heart was as sad as a patient's when he couldn't give her water.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525296.mp3	So I stare blankly into the face of my mom.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525298.mp3	You can have wealth in the Supreme Court.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525299.mp3	He felt a certain disappointment circling that glowing light.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525305.mp3	Moreover, Shin Chul-yi is good at everything he does, so he was given the role of housewife.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525309.mp3	When it was Shin's turn, he slung a bag of cement over his shoulder.	dev
common_voice_ko_36525313.mp3	What should I eat today?	dev
common_voice_ko_36525315.mp3	Out of sight, out of mind	dev
common_voice_ko_35850231.mp3	And he surely saw that fair face of the Zen master pass by with a smile.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850233.mp3	We're each busy paving our own way.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850234.mp3	Because they have not received my instruction, but have despised all my reproof.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850365.mp3	A Dragon Rises from the Stream	dev
common_voice_ko_35850368.mp3	I was nervous and excited all the way through that allegro.	dev

common_voice_ko_35850371.mp3	Each time she did, she would open a drawer and grab whatever she'd left in the box.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850372.mp3	I already had this idea, but couldn't easily capitalize on the opportunity.	dev

common_voice_ko_35850518.mp3	Hyo-ae was still babbling on and on.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850519.mp3	After lunch, members took a break to chat.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850520.mp3	Young-shin echoed Dong-hyuk's words from earlier at Mr. Baek's house.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850616.mp3	There should be someone in the world who knows how you feel.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850617.mp3	Ok Jum looked at Shin Chul with a smile in his eyes.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850619.mp3	I was crying, and I was overcome with emotion.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850620.mp3	The two sons were in the room, bickering like they were going to devour each other over the dead man's invoices.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850623.mp3	His chest heaved at the sound of the jailer's bellowing.	dev

common_voice_ko_35850711.mp3	He had a habit of doing this whenever he liked.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850745.mp3	He tried to clear his head and look at it.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850746.mp3	Impeachment is only a removal from office.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850747.mp3	His mother sprang to her feet in a fit of evil and rushed to her firstborn.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850748.mp3	On the one hand, he wants to understand as a favor, as he can be a spirit being.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850749.mp3	The monk grimaced and looked at the end of the yarn being pulled from the kiln.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850780.mp3	Even though I was very hungry, I decided not to eat anything for the time being.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850784.mp3	Shin Chul walked out the door, hearing Young Chul crying.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850786.mp3	Or you can think of it as a story that takes place forty years in the future, set on a ship.	dev

common_voice_ko_35850834.mp3	Deok-ho stands in the doorway and looks at his mother, worried.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850837.mp3	Then, with a couple of slaps of the moor, he disappears behind a field of wheat.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850838.mp3	He felt like he would be lost without touching it, so he just held on to it.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850840.mp3	At the same time, the pain he'd briefly forgotten assaulted his entire body unbearably.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850842.mp3	First, they walked heartlessly, then they circled around Deokho's house and came to his house.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850875.mp3	Give me your opinion as a socializer.”	dev
common_voice_ko_35850877.mp3	He finally said in disgust.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850879.mp3	The only thing missing was a whitewashed chapel.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850880.mp3	The elders and other church members came in and repeatedly urged him to go to the hospital.	dev
common_voice_ko_35850881.mp3	So he walked back out, wondering if he was in the wrong place, hesitated, and then went back in.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852120.mp3	I didn't worry about the	dev
common_voice_ko_35852122.mp3	A golden tablet deep in the mountains.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852124.mp3	Even though it was the day of the Gogura Suit, I went out in the rain to chase after Kim Chum-ji.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852125.mp3	His voice, which had been so energized, seemed to disappear into thin air.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852127.mp3	If I teased my arm, my arm hurt, if I teased my leg, my leg hurt.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852201.mp3	The State shall make every effort to rehabilitate the non-recipients.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852202.mp3	As he silently opens the door, the clock next door strikes two.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852204.mp3	Young-sook looked into Chun-woo's mind again.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852205.mp3	He was already a skeleton to begin with, but his addition made it seem like he was dealing with a skeleton.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852207.mp3	There's nothing to be gained by doing so.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852235.mp3	I stood up, walked over to the piano, and placed a gentle hand on his shoulder.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852236.mp3	The Nanjang Bodhisattva struck the ground with his hoe and shouted, “I'm sorry.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852237.mp3	This Honor of the People of Sigilon	dev
common_voice_ko_35852238.mp3	Comrade Shin didn't quite understand what he was saying and looked at Shin Chul as he repeated, “I'm sorry.	dev
common_voice_ko_35852239.mp3	He walked to one side of the street, dodging this way and that.	dev
common_voice_ko_35887285.mp3	And he could see the road ahead of him as clearly as the side of the road.	dev
common_voice_ko_35887286.mp3	I vaguely remembered the jade dealer introducing the tailor to his father earlier.	dev
common_voice_ko_35887287.mp3	It's a no-brainer to run	dev
common_voice_ko_35887288.mp3	Three years old spoiled to eighty	dev
common_voice_ko_35887289.mp3	A twig that was hit by rain is spiky.	dev
common_voice_ko_35972929.mp3	I was arrested as soon as I walked in the door.	dev
common_voice_ko_35972930.mp3	There's only one secret to success: focusing fanatically on what you can do well.	dev
common_voice_ko_35972931.mp3	Shin couldn't finish the meal and got up to leave.	dev
common_voice_ko_35972932.mp3	Your old and poor Mo cannot die, so he goes on with his life in his hands.	dev
common_voice_ko_35972933.mp3	Gannan was also unhappy to see Deokho's face.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845682.mp3	I said the hard thing to say.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845802.mp3	Soon enough, the hot month of August was over with only one day left.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845804.mp3	Judicial power belongs to a court of justices.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845806.mp3	And they were happy when they realized that the inspiration had become the chief.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845836.mp3	In the near future, strange rumors circulated among Chun Woo's colleagues.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845838.mp3	“I don't know, they said something glowed.”	dev
common_voice_ko_35845839.mp3	Shin Chul-i felt the insult all over his body, like he was about to fall underground.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845871.mp3	Only when she called out again did he leave.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845873.mp3	You'll have to take her word for it.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845874.mp3	However, there was no sign of popularity and it was quiet.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845876.mp3	He walks into the room and Gannan is there, doing his thing.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845931.mp3	Goodbye.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845932.mp3	As long as there is life, there is hope.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845933.mp3	I couldn't sleep because I didn't know how or where to start.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845934.mp3	Worshiping the sky until the day I die	dev
common_voice_ko_35845987.mp3	And then the dark room flashes by.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845988.mp3	When she finished, she choked up and bowed her head, pulling at her skirt to wipe away her tears.	dev
common_voice_ko_35845989.mp3	And when recognition arose in his heart, righteousness seemed to arise.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846031.mp3	Why can't you keep your eyes open!	dev
common_voice_ko_35846032.mp3	He closed his eyes tightly, trying to sleep.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846034.mp3	Just as he had hoped, Young-shin was able to relax in a house by the sea.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846067.mp3	Catch the untouchable star in the sky.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846097.mp3	followed by the sound of a throat clearing.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846099.mp3	And he repeated what he had said.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846100.mp3	Where is the eternal?	dev
common_voice_ko_35846190.mp3	Sensing that the director was coming over, he quickly bowed his head.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846194.mp3	The wind blew the tree limb away, and we're not sure where it went.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846212.mp3	I screamed at the top of my lungs and turned around to find it was an unexpected duck.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846213.mp3	Those were the last words Jesus cried out as he was crucified.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846214.mp3	In this furrow, the Jobangi wept more.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846215.mp3	In the meantime, someone else is carrying the load.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846247.mp3	He's already at Kannan's house before he realizes that he's repeating these thoughts.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846249.mp3	It's like someone who's lost a form is trying to pass the baton.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846250.mp3	When Chun Yu saw the parasite, his eyes grew wide and his heart fluttered.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846251.mp3	The courts are organized into a supreme court, the Supreme Court, and lower courts.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846266.mp3	So he forced a smile.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846267.mp3	I could only scold him and run around in circles.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846269.mp3	Shin Chul-yi suddenly realized that his nose was bleeding.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846271.mp3	Lay him down and examine him closely.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846273.mp3	Nostalgic, Yingxin threw away the crown, went into her room, and came out with a handful of folding fan.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846326.mp3	What time do you want to leave work?	dev
common_voice_ko_35846328.mp3	The National Assembly reviews the qualifications of lawmakers and can discipline them.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846330.mp3	And Adam gave names to every cattle, and to every fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846331.mp3	Anderson chuckled as he realized what the bizarre scarecrow was really about.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846334.mp3	I later learned that these women were the wives of rice millers.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846364.mp3	Behind them, houses like crab scabs are being chased away.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846365.mp3	And I saw that his garments were soaked with sweat, and that they were dried.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846366.mp3	Chun Woo realized that his father was drunk.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846367.mp3	It gurgled, spread through my intestines, and burned my face.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846368.mp3	The wind shoots like the sound of the waves and whips my hair out of my face.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846392.mp3	I should tell Chun Woo all about it.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846396.mp3	As they went on their way, carrying their forks, they said, “This is the way it is.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846397.mp3	Donghyuk felt a sense of mystery and wanted to sing a song.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846400.mp3	The moment he saw Deokho's face, blood rushed to his head and his entire body trembled.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846423.mp3	His pace was such that a passerby would be worried.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846427.mp3	The Zen master was suspicious of what Gannan was pondering whenever he returned so late.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846428.mp3	The kitchen is beautifully decorated.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846462.mp3	Shin Chul-yi was discouraged because his grandmother had woken up.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846507.mp3	He puts on a flat face and looks at the first one.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846508.mp3	And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, and hid themselves among the trees of the garden.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846510.mp3	I asked him a second time.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846511.mp3	No news is good news	dev
common_voice_ko_35846512.mp3	Instead of answering, he always smiles like this.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846578.mp3	But when I picked it up, I realized that it was made of stone dust, which is why it was so heavy.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846580.mp3	For ye hate knowledge, and take no pleasure in the fear of the LORD.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846581.mp3	The match has begun.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846614.mp3	He came to the side of the Six Hundred and Three Horsemen's palanquin and patted his comrade on the shoulder.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846616.mp3	So Mother Gannan squinted her eyes and looked at him.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846617.mp3	And then I heard the sound of a dog whimpering.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846619.mp3	But I can't really point to a single thing and say that it's a withdrawal.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846620.mp3	If it is free to give, it must be free to receive.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846641.mp3	It seems to have been adopted with enthusiasm.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846643.mp3	Remaining unfazed in times of hardship is the mark of a truly admirable character.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846644.mp3	The spirit spirit appeals to the object of faith as if calling out again.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846677.mp3	He came to the other corner of the house, out of breath, and stared at it for a long time.	dev
common_voice_ko_35846680.mp3	And I didn't want to be in this place for a second.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549538.mp3	And suddenly, an indescribable force filled his chest.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549540.mp3	Dong-hyeok's large eyes seem to look right through Young-shin's heart.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549541.mp3	was the idea.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549542.mp3	I glanced at Dukho, wondering if I should say it again.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549549.mp3	My father was definitely alive.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549550.mp3	He glances back at Young-shin, who stands with his eyes down, tiptoeing in the sand, and Dong-hyuk gives him an order.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549551.mp3	Suddenly, I heard Eun-hee singing softly to me.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549552.mp3	My son, listen not to instruction that leads away from the word of knowledge.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549580.mp3	The first one backed off a bit and laid down, as if he was bothered.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549583.mp3	I thought you said you couldn't drink?	dev
common_voice_ko_36549592.mp3	Huddled in a corner, the girls clutch their handkerchiefs to their mouths and hold their waists.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549593.mp3	And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Shiloh, hear my voice.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549594.mp3	Dong Hyuk never left the patient's bedside.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549597.mp3	He coughs a couple of times and walks out.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549602.mp3	Thank you	dev
common_voice_ko_36549604.mp3	I picked out the end of the thread, squeezed it tightly, and attached it to the needle.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549605.mp3	It's a bar near my school and all the shopkeepers, there wasn't a person who hadn't been beaten up by him.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549606.mp3	When my grandfather dies, I will die too.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549607.mp3	The bishop squinted at the master's bowed cheeks and never left their sight.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549611.mp3	He jumped to his feet, rather pleasantly surprised.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549612.mp3	The lid of the spatula is held in a snug fit.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549616.mp3	I'm studying hard right now.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549617.mp3	The young master falters when he sees that the spirit is in a bad mood.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549620.mp3	He was about to ask his grandmother what else she had to say when he turned around and went into his room.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549622.mp3	He sat back and smirked, thinking of the dockworkers' future victories.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549624.mp3	The boys turn their heads toward them and clap their hands.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549626.mp3	A cool breeze whistles past his burning cheeks.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549627.mp3	It's been a decade of this frustration, with the excitement and the inversely proportional lack of coolness that comes with it.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549628.mp3	The father glares at Yin Wu, who is about to expose him for his crimes.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549629.mp3	A few days later, the Zen master was called into the bishop's office.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549630.mp3	Young God wrote and erased with his finger in the sand.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549631.mp3	But the cough struggled to rise, unfortunately burning a tickle in his throat.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549644.mp3	Young Shin was so grateful that he held their hands and was speechless several times.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549645.mp3	But there was too much painful, heavy, powerful emotion in there for it not to be music.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549647.mp3	I see.	dev
common_voice_ko_36549648.mp3	The moderator takes a few steps toward Chae Young Shin's side of the room and urges her to get up.	dev
common_voice_ko_36590126.mp3	He has yet to find another who wears such a shabby suit and a bowler hat as he does.	dev
common_voice_ko_36590128.mp3	And now he realized that his hand had released his displeased thoughts.	dev
common_voice_ko_36590132.mp3	Before I knew it, the vault was filled with the limited eighty people.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203217.mp3	We're still getting signups for this workout.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203218.mp3	But I didn't think I'd be able to walk down the street with them with a forklift.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203226.mp3	The sweaty rottenness of my endogenous etiology, mixed with the coldness of my mixed coldness, poked his blunt nose.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203227.mp3	We wish you the best of luck with your work.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203231.mp3	Sweat beads on his forehead, but he does not wash it off, but sits close to the presence of the spirit gods.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203232.mp3	Where is the restroom here?	dev
common_voice_ko_38203235.mp3	By now, Shin Chul-yi had stopped walking and stood tall.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203246.mp3	Gannan was one of the master's closest comrades.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203247.mp3	Not only that, but Youngshin sometimes acts as a judge.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203249.mp3	He decided to circle the area and observe the situation.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203261.mp3	What do you think of someone who wouldn't even think about it, let alone care, if it weren't for such an absolutely bizarre opportunity?	dev
common_voice_ko_38203263.mp3	I returned safely to my workplace with infinite gratitude and a heart full of emotion.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203272.mp3	Ugh, no answer again. Are you really dead, Buzzie.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203273.mp3	How pretty is that?	dev
common_voice_ko_38203275.mp3	I hope this isn't a dream.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203296.mp3	Comrade interrupted, looking toward the door.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203297.mp3	It was not until the evening of the angel's death that he was finally examined by a doctor, but he was still in a coma.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203299.mp3	A crescent moon hangs askew in the west, like a crack in its lid.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203311.mp3	Chun Woo went over there and sat down across from Young Sook.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203312.mp3	It's not a bad thing to be old-fashioned, but he's fun when you give him a bottle of medicine and send him on his way.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203322.mp3	Moreover, the first was known for being a good drinker and a good manipulator.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203323.mp3	The water that went down his throat was soon sweetened.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203324.mp3	The Zen master's mother tried everything, but to no avail.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203325.mp3	Young-sook was silent for a long time.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203336.mp3	Deok-ho is uncomfortable facing Seon-bi, so he drags his mother's hand into the room.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203337.mp3	But he doesn't know the art.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203408.mp3	He rises to his knees, calling out softly, as if he's only just discovered his son's shadow after years.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203412.mp3	Suddenly don't feel like eating chestnut bread?	dev
common_voice_ko_38203413.mp3	Don't shoot, military son is a hostage.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203457.mp3	The hole could barely fit a hand, let alone a person.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203462.mp3	Hey, you called me.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203463.mp3	What was stuck in his head now was the opposite jade dot.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203479.mp3	He came back to the other side of the alley and looked at it for a long time.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203480.mp3	If you have a bunch of chromatic and gradient chords with no resolution, you can use the	dev
common_voice_ko_38203499.mp3	I'm not a lefty	dev
common_voice_ko_38203500.mp3	With these thoughts in mind, Chun Woo's mind returned to his body.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203526.mp3	I rolled those scary eyes and looked at my daughter.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203527.mp3	Minsoo couldn't sleep that night and kept thinking about it over and over again.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203539.mp3	As he lay down, the Zen master turned over.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203541.mp3	They lay side by side, like brothers, and talked long after the fire was extinguished.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203550.mp3	I let them all out, except for the original mother, and then hung the doorknob inside.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203551.mp3	It was only then that I pulled off the covers, got up, and saw my mother.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203553.mp3	Before he could turn around and think about it, Jade Mistress sneered, “You're right.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203554.mp3	It stabs the suits in the side as they bob this way and that like candlesticks on an open flame.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203566.mp3	The wicked flee when no man pursueth them: but the righteous are bold as a lion.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203567.mp3	His eyes widened as he remembered how Shin Chul had hugged him tightly last night.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203568.mp3	The lady servant fumbles and bows down to ask.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203569.mp3	He stands on his wooden legs and looks at the first one in a cute way.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203570.mp3	You can use Mastodon instead of Twitter.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203578.mp3	Off	dev
common_voice_ko_38203581.mp3	In the distance, you can hear the crackle and crackle of machinery chopping wood in a lumberyard.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203593.mp3	Goddamned bitch, what can I do?	dev
common_voice_ko_38203594.mp3	He is my shepherd.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203597.mp3	Once upon a time, there were two thieves here.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203598.mp3	Mobile game users organize a carriage protest near Kakao Games to attract attention.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203614.mp3	He watched the old woman get up and followed her.	dev
common_voice_ko_38203616.mp3	The Viceroy is entering!	dev

common_voice_ko_36880069.mp3	At the same time, my fond feelings dispersed like clouds and fogged over.	train
common_voice_ko_36880070.mp3	Even so, Ki-cheon gulped it down without breathing because Dong-hyuk was eating it.	train
common_voice_ko_36880071.mp3	Everything was good, but the beans were a little sour.	train
common_voice_ko_36880073.mp3	It was a very accurate statistic that members had been researching for months.	train
common_voice_ko_36880074.mp3	He soon felt like crying.	train
common_voice_ko_36880075.mp3	Don't take your clothes off like that	train
common_voice_ko_36880076.mp3	Unaware that he had been pronounced dead by the doctor, Youngshin regained consciousness slightly from the energy of the injection.	train
common_voice_ko_36880077.mp3	The weather can't be predicted with 100% accuracy either.	train
